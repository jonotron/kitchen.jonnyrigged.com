We started off trying to make a simple BBQ chicken and pepper pizza. I had some bacon in the fridge for another project (which I forgot to use) so I fried up some bacon to flavour the pizza a bit. I also undercooked two pieces of the chicken and, in a flash of brilliance, I fixed it by finishing them in the bacon fat pan thus creating "bacon chicken". 

> Chicken cooked in bacon + bacon + cheddar = Bacon Chicken Bacon Cheddar!

Always an opportunist to create a scientific experiment, I added the **chicken** to one pizza and the **bacon chicken** to the other to see if we could taste the difference. 

**Hypothesis:**
Exciting bacon chicken is tastier than boring chicken chicken.

**Conclusion:** Obviously.
