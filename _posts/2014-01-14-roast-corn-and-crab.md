Julie's brother suggested these ingredients and we needed to use up some crab in the freezer. My thought was that the corn would need a bit of spice to add flavour to the pizza, but not so much as to over-power the crab.

> Keep your fresh crab halves in the freezer, but not for longer than 2-3 months as the protein will start to break down.

We tried a new risen dough recipe which turned out quite nicely, though it could have risen a bit more before rolling out. I don't often have crab on the ready either, so this was a fun pie to make.

The final flavour of the pizza was nice, subtle hints of crab and sweetness of corn. The alfredo sauce was quite mild and allowed the crab to come through where a tomato sauce would have overpowered the crab. I would add a bit more spice next time (maybe some chilli peper).

**Final thoughts**: 6 month old frozen crab still tastes good on a pizza!
