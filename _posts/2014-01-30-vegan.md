A nod to our ridiculous vegan and vegetarian friends, we have constructed our first fully certified vegan-izza!

We use Daiya cheese, which is a dairy free cheese alternative that has some more cheese like properties compared to other cheese alternatives (it melts and stretches like real cheese making it a great choice for pizza).

> Must find more vegan friends... wait... maybe not.

The toppings are relatively simple, but a regular favourite for us... broccoli and cauliflower.

The dough was the same thin crust recipe we have been making (to be featured more detailed in a future post). Julie **knocked it out of the park** this time though and it was about as good as it can get.

> Thin crust has less calories... or something

This pizza was suprisingly quick to make, tasted quite fine for a meatless pie and would be suitable to serve to your hard-to-feed vegan friends.
