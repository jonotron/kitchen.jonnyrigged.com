This is our first "pizza away from home" as part of this 52 pizzas journey. We played guest at some friends' house at Sun Peaks this past weekend. Cross country skiing, followed by pulled pork pizza, followed by [Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/).

We used some left-over sous vide pulled pork that I had made the week before ([my first attempt](http://instagram.com/p/ixhsjzHIpf/) at sous vide cooking). It was pretty spectacular.

We used the same dough recipe from our [Roast Corn and Crab]({% post_url 2014-01-14-roast-corn-and-crab %}) pizza, but with slightly **disasterous** results. We basically par-cooked the dough instead of rising it. I choose to blame this on our friend's poor quality oven, and insist that they revamp their kitchen and purchase all new appliances.

The flavour of the toppings were tastey enough and combined nicely with the pinapple. It could have used a bit more spice and a bit of onion.

I also discovered that our pizzas are becoming a little boring looking. They all photograph more-or-less the same as the cheese obscures the toppings. This pizza could have been mostly inverted with the warmed pulled pork added on top after baking the cheese.
